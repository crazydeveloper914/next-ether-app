# Smart Contracts

This project demonstrates how to add smart contracts to your project using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/docs). It provides a sample `Message` contract, a test and deployment scripts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```
yarn build
yarn deploy
yarn test
yarn coverage
```

Once you're ready to deploy your contracts to a testnet, setup a deployer account using `process.env.DEPLOYER_KEY` and try to run `yarn deploy --network sepolia`. You might need testnet Ethers for that. More info and faucet links can be found on [Sepolia Dev](https://sepolia.dev/).
